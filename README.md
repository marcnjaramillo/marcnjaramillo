## About Me

My name is Marc, and I'm a software engineer based in San Diego, CA. Before I got into coding, I worked as a sign language interpreter. I decided to make a career change around 2016 and went through a bootcamp with Flatiron School where I learned Ruby on Rails and React. After I finished, I kept learning and growing my skillset to include MongoDB, Apollo, GraphQL, Node/Express, TypeScript, and Rust.

Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking, spending time with friends and family, reading, video games, and movies and TV shows. My wife and I both love _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_ and we've enjoyed the new things that have come out lately. As for gaming, we love _Breath of the Wild_ and the _Horizon Zero Dawn_ series. These games are a lot of fun, and it's nice to just run around and explore. When it comes to cooking, I especially enjoy Italian. There's a lot I want to try but don't have the space or set up for. Hopefully we can afford a house one day, and you'd better believe the thing that will make or break the deal is the kitchen!

## Projects
I started working on a custom ecommerce site using React and Shopify Storefront API because I've always been fascinated by ecommerce platforms. I got everything set up using the Shopify Storefront GraphQL API and created my own image assets and branding with Photoshop and Illustrator. I'm still working on adding features, and I plan to create a fully customized store complete with an admin dashboard and customer account capabilities.

Another passion project of mine is actually a project that inspired me to get into software engineering in the first place. As an interpreter, I noticed there was a lot of room for improvement when it came to how our assignments were scheduled and distributed, and how we managed our invoices. I wanted to create a platform that was really designed for us and made the entire process of managing interpreting assignments more user-friendly.

## Fun Fact
I've been a woodwind player (specifically clarinet and saxophone) for 24 years. I can play a number of woodwind instruments and piano. I love music and I enjoy listening to pieces and finding the melodies, harmonies, and occasionally I try to figure out a song by ear.
